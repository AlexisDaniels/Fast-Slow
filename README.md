Title: A simulation study exploring the effects of excluding an important slow-changing variable from a network of depression.

This repository is for my Research Master's Thesis Project. It contains all R functions used for the analysis (graphicalVARsim_MultiTime & bootstrappin). Moreover, it contains the R script of the variability reduction method, the modification of the beta matrices, the calculation of all centrality tables, and the simulation/estimation of all networks.
